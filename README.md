# Multimodal-Chat-Asst
A Python script that extracts text from YouTube/local video frames using Gemini API (Tesseract fallback) and summarizes it. Outputs only the final summary for a clean, vibe-coded experienceâ€”perfect for quick video content insights.

# Key Features
  -It processes the YouTube or Local video based on the audio(OpenAI's Whisper) not on transcripts.
  -We can Fetch the overall summary and the segmented summary based on the entered 'time-frame'.
  -It is completely built by AI agents (Grok3 and Google AI Studio) which gave me the vibe coding experience.
